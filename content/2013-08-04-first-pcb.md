Earlier this morning, I received 10 of these beauties in my mailbox:

This is a development board I designed to ease prototyping with Atmel's [tiny 85](http://www.atmel.com/devices/attiny85.aspx) micro-controllers.
It's a rather basic design with the tiny 85 in a DIP8 package in the center with traces to expose 5 of its digital pins (PB0 to PB4) plus ground and VCC via a header to the top.  
To the bottom, other traces connect to a 10-pin ISP connector for programming.  
There is also a power indicator led, a reset button and decoupling caps, and that's about it.

Here's an assembled board connected to the programmer and plugged in a breadboard:

I've created this board using Eagle CAD. Here's the schematic:

And the part list:

| Part   | Value | Device                 |               Package |
|--------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------|
| BRAINZ |       | ATTINY85               |                       |
| C1     | 0.1uF | Ceramic disc capacitor |                  0805 |
| C2     | 100uF | Electrolytic capacitor | CPOL-RADIAL-100UF-25V |
| PWR    |       | LED                    |                  0805 |
| PWR_R  | 1K    | Resistor               |                  0805 |
| RESET  |       | Tactile switch         |           TACTILE-PTH |
| RST_R  | 10K   | Resistor               |                  0805 |
               

This PCB design was fabbed using [Seeed Studio's fusion service](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-2-layers-p-835.html): an incredibly cheap offer where you get 10 5cmx5cm PCBs for only 9.99$.

I soldered components on 2 of them, and after a bit of stumbling and yak shaving, mainly due to a buggy USBasp programmer, I got the boards to work beautifully.

It was also my first time soldering SMD devices (0805 resistors, capacitors and leds).  
I was shocked the first time I hold a 0805 resistor in one hand with the iron in the other.
It was tiny.
Really tiny.
I was like *no way I'm going to be able to solder this*.
But it wasn't that bad.  
The only part I struggled with was the power indicator led, and it turned out I was trying to solder the wrong package (a 1206) which was bigger than the pads.

*/me very proud !*
