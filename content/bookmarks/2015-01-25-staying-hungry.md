title: Staying Hungry, Staying Foolish

> The problem is that when we start out as software developers we don’t know the “right way” to do things so we are less constrained in what we do.  We just march forward and go do things.
> As we start to learn the “right way” to do things, we are often stifled by that knowledge and the constraints it brings and that causes us to be less productive or to over engineer and design solutions to problems.
